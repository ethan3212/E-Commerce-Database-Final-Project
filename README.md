# E-Commerce-Database-Final-Project

This is the final project I worked on for a database class I took in college. It is a basic database for an E-Commerce website.

I determined what information was needed, how many tables needed to be created, normalized them, and then wrote the SQL code to create it.

The attached SQL script is intended to be run as a single batch. When run it will: create the database "ManisTermProjectDB", create and populate the tables, and create and execute
  five queries and views.
