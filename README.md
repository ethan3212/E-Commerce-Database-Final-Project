My final project in college was a basic database for an E-Commerce website.

I determined which information was essential, divided and categorized it into tables, normalized them, and wrote the SQL script.

This SQL script is intended to be ran as a single batch. It will: create the database "ManisTermProjectDB", generate the tables, populate them with data, and then execute five query functions and one view.
