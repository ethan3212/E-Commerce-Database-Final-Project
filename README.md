My final project in coll was a basic database for an E-Commerce wwebsite.

I determined the information that was essential, divided and categorized them into tables, normalized them, and wrote the SQL script.

This SQL script is intended to be ran as a single batch. When run, it will: create the database, "ManisTermProjectDB", generate the tables, populate them with data, and then execute a series of five queries and one view.
